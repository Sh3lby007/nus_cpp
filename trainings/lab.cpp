Alexandra has n candles. He burns them one at a time and

residual wax of exactly k (where k > 1) candles, he can roll
out a new candle

Consider the case of n=5, k=3

After burning the first 3 candles, Alexandra has enough
residual wax to roll out the 6th candle. After burning this
new candle with candles 4 and 5, he has enough residual wax
to roll out the 7th candle. Burning the 7th candle would not
result in enough residual wax to roll out anymore new candle.
Therefore, in total he can burn 7 candles.
